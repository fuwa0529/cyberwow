CyberWOW is a pruned full node for Wownero.

Wownero is a privacy-centric memecoin that was fairly launched on April 1, 2018
with no pre-mine, stealth-mine or ICO. Wownero has a maximum supply of around
184 million WOW with a slow and steady emission over 50 years. It is a fork of
Monero, but with its own genesis block, so there is no degradation of privacy
due to ring signatures using different participants for the same tx outputs on
opposing forks.
